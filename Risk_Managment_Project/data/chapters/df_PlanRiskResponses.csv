  address interaction risks responses responses may developed address risks related either cause effect common root cause
categorization risks example using tools risk breakdown structure afﬁ nity diagram categorizing tools may help identify address situation
need plan risk responses process consider risks aggregated perform quantitative risk analysis process eg ten small related risks combined may pose big risk project develop generic responses possible
another interaction effect may occur one risk occurs may affect probability impact risks
deciding response strategy may require compromise since proposed responses may exclusive counterproductive
example mitigating threat time could cost money increasing pressure budget
risk response planning needs take holistic view proposed responses make sure coherent
