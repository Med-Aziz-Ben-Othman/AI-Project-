Here are the details of the new project: 
        This project is simply making cereal for breakfast, including sourcing the cereal and milk, a bowl, and a spoon.

        Outcome: You’re no longer hungry, and you’re ready to start the day.

        Delineate the tasks: 
        1. Go to the supermarket
        2. Buy a bowl
        3. Buy a spoon
        4. Buy a bottle of milk
        5. Buy a box of cereal
        6. Return home
        7. Place the bowl on the counter
        8. Pour the cereal into the bowl
        9. Pour the milk into the bowl
        10. Place the spoon in the bowl, and eat

        The tasks in a project often have strong dependencies. For larger projects, these can often be harder to spot, which is why you have to spend the time mapping out each part of the process and building a timeline.
        
        Identify the players: For eating breakfast, it is probably just yourself, unless you have a son or a daughter who helps out in the morning. Risks include not having one of the supplies, or realizing that the milk has expired.

        Timeline: For breakfast, the timeline is immediate.

        Review: You may decide to use less honey tomorrow or add something new like fruit to your cereal for added vitamins (and taste).
