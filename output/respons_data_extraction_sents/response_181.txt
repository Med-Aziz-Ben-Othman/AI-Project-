Based on the provided sentence, we can identify key concepts, entities, and relationships in the context of project management risks. Here’s the structured extraction:

### Nodes (Entities):
1. **Time**
2. **Development**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Risk**
5. **Response**
6. **Cost**
7. **Science**
8. **Enhancement**

### Relationships:
1. **Maximize**: (Time) → (Development)
2. **Mitigate**: (Implementation) → (Risk)
3. **Incur**: (Response) → (Cost)
4. **Enhance**: (Response) → (Science)
5. **Delay**: (Response) → (Cost) (implying that a delayed response may lead to higher costs)
6. **Take**: (Response) → (Time) (implying that a response may take time)

### Attributes/Characteristics:
- **Time**: Available, Limited
- **Development**: Related to project tasks
- **Implementation**: Stages in the project lifecycle
- **Risk**: Associated with potential project failures or challenges
- **Response**: Strategies or actions taken to address risks
- **Cost**: Considered as a consequence of response actions
- **Science**: Suggests methodical or evidence-based approaches to enhancing responses

This structured extraction can aid in understanding the interplay between these concepts in the context of project management and the associated risks.
