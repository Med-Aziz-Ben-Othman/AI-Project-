Based on the provided text "processrelated criterion," we can extract the following nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Process**
   - Definition: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular end in project management.
   
2. **Criterion**
   - Definition: A standard or principle by which something is judged or decided, particularly in assessing project risks.

### Relationships:
1. **is_assessed_by**
   - Relationship: The "Process" can be assessed by the "Criterion" to evaluate risks associated with the process.

### Attributes:
- **Process**
  - Attributes: 
    - Type: (e.g., Planning, Execution, Monitoring)
    - Importance: (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
  
- **Criterion**
  - Attributes:
    - Type: (e.g., Qualitative, Quantitative)
    - Relevance: (e.g., Specific to process, General)

### Summary:
In summary, we have identified two key nodes—Process and Criterion—along with a relationship indicating how the criterion is used to assess risks related to processes in project management, along with relevant attributes for each node.
