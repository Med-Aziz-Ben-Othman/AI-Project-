Based on the provided sentence, I will extract the relevant nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks.

### Nodes (Entities)
1. Risk Probability
2. Risk Impact
3. Specific Objective
4. Tool
5. Risk Priority
6. Term
7. Objective

### Relationships
1. **Prioritizes**: Risk Probability and Risk Impact are prioritized in relation to Specific Objective.
2. **Affects**: Risk Priority affects the Specific Objective.
3. **Permits**: Tool permits the distinction of Risk Priority.
4. **Distinguishes**: Tool distinguishes between different Risk Priority terms.
5. **Relates**: Risk Probability is related to Risk Impact in the context of assessing risks.

### Attributes
- **Risk Probability**: Represents the likelihood of a risk occurring.
- **Risk Impact**: Represents the potential effect or consequence of a risk if it occurs.
- **Specific Objective**: Defined target or goal that is impacted by risks.
- **Tool**: Instrument or method used for risk assessment and prioritization.
- **Risk Priority**: Hierarchy or order of importance assigned to risks based on their probability and impact.
- **Term**: Refers to the specific language or categorization used in risk assessment.

### Structured Representation
Using the extracted nodes, relationships, and attributes, we can structure them as follows:

1. **Risk Probability**
   - Attribute: Likelihood of occurrence
   - Relationship: Prioritizes → Risk Impact

2. **Risk Impact**
   - Attribute: Potential consequences
   - Relationship: Affects → Specific Objective

3. **Specific Objective**
   - Attribute: Defined target
   - Relationship: Affected by → Risk Priority

4. **Tool**
   - Attribute: Method for risk assessment
   - Relationships:
     - Permits → Distinction of Risk Priority
     - Distinguishes → Risk Priority terms

5. **Risk Priority**
   - Attribute: Order of importance
   - Relationships:
     - Affects → Specific Objective
     - Related to → Risk Probability and Risk Impact

6. **Term**
   - Attribute: Specific language used
   - Relationship: Distinguishes → Risk Priority

7. **Objective**
   - Attribute: End goal
   - Relationship: Affected by → Risk Priority

This structured extraction captures the essential elements of project management risks as represented in the provided sentence, facilitating further analysis or modeling.
