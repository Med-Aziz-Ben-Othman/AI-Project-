Based on the provided sentence, here is an analysis to extract nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Project Management**
2. **Project Risk Management**
3. **Process**
4. **Task**
5. **Overhead**
6. **View**
7. **Importance** (inferred from "important")
8. **Effectiveness** (inferred from "effective")
9. **Optional** (inferred from "optional")

### Relationships:
1. **is related to**: Project Management ↔ Project Risk Management
2. **includes**: Project Risk Management → Process
3. **requires**: Project Risk Management → Task
4. **adds**: Task → Overhead
5. **is assessed by**: Project Risk Management ↔ View
6. **is considered**: Project Management ↔ Importance
