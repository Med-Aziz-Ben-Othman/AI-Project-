Based on the provided sentence, I can extract the following nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Result Risk**
2. **Probability**
3. **Project Objective**
4. **Fishing Time**
5. **Budget**

### Relationships:
1. **Consider**: The act of evaluating or taking into account the "Result Risk."
2. **Include**: Indicates that "Probability" is a factor that must be considered when assessing "Result Risk."
3. **Follow**: Suggests that certain actions or considerations should come after evaluating "Probability."
4. **Achieve**: Relates "Probability" to the ability to "Achieve" the "Project Objective."
5. **Within**: Specifies the constraints of "Fishing Time" and "Budget" as parameters that must be adhered to in the project.

### Attributes:
- **Result Risk**: Represents the uncertain outcome related to achieving project objectives.
- **Probability**: A numerical or qualitative measure indicating the likelihood of a risk impacting the project.
- **Project Objective**: The goals that the project aims to achieve.
- **Fishing Time**: The duration allocated for specific tasks or milestones within the project.
- **Budget**: The financial resources allocated for the project.

### Summary:
The sentence suggests that when managing project risks, it is crucial to consider the result risks associated with achieving project objectives, taking into account the probability of those risks, and ensuring that project activities (like fishing time) are completed within the established budget.
