Based on the provided sentence, we can extract the following nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Objectivity**
   - Type: Quality/Concept
   - Attributes: Essential for decision-making, reduces bias

2. **Human Activity**
   - Type: Process/Entity
   - Attributes: Involves decision-making, can be influenced by various factors

3. **Bias**
   - Type: Concept/Challenge
   - Attributes: Affects judgment, leads to potential misalignment with project goals

4. **Uncertainty**

   - Attributes: Inherent in project management, impacts planning and outcomes

### Relationships:
1. **Human Activity → Bias**
   - Relationship: Influences
   - Description: Human activity is influenced by bias, which can distort decision-making.

2. **Bias → Objectivity**
   - Relationship: Reduces
   - Description: Bias reduces objectivity in assessments and evaluations.

3. **Objectivity → Uncertainty**
   - Relationship: Mitigates
   - Description: Maintaining objectivity helps to mitigate uncertainty in project management.

4. **Human Activity → Uncertainty**
   - Relationship: Contributes to
   - Description: Human activity can contribute to uncertainty due to unpredictable behaviors and decisions.

### Summary
In this analysis, the focus is on how human activity can lead to bias, affecting the objectivity of decisions within project management, ultimately contributing to uncertainty, which is a significant risk factor in project management. Each node represents a critical concept, and the relationships illustrate how they interact and impact project management risks.
