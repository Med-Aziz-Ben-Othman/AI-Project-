Based on the provided sentence, the following nodes, relationships, and attributes can be extracted:

### Nodes:
1. **Probability Distribution**
2. **Project Completion Date**
3. **Total Cost**
4. **Expected Value**
5. **Project Decision**

### Relationships:
1. **Influences**:
   - Probability Distribution → Project Completion Date
   - Probability Distribution → Total Cost
   - Probability Distribution → Expected Value

2. **Affects**:
   - Project Completion Date → Total Cost
   - Project Decision → Expected Value

3. **Determines**:
   - Total Cost → Expected Value

### Attributes:
- **Probability Distribution**: Represents the uncertainty in project completion.
- **Project Completion Date**: The anticipated date when the project will be completed.
- **Total Cost**: The overall budget required for the project.
- **Expected Value**: The calculated average outcome that takes into account probabilities.
- **Project Decision**: The choices made regarding project management based on the analysis of the above factors.

These elements can be conceptualized in a graph where the nodes represent key components of project management risks, and the edges represent the relationships that define how these components interact with each other.
