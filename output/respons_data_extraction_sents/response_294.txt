Based on the provided text, here are the extracted nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Priority** 
2. **Base Risk**
3. **Probability**
4. **Occurrence**
5. **Potential Impact**
6. **Specific Project Objectives**
7. **Whole Project**

### Relationships:
- **Priority** relates to **Base Risk** (Priority of risks can influence how they are managed).
- **Base Risk** has an associated **Probability** (Base risks have a likelihood of occurrence).
- **Probability** is linked to **Occurrence** (Probability indicates the chance of a risk occurring).
- **Occurrence** affects **Potential Impact** (The occurrence of risks can lead to impacts on the project).
- **Potential Impact** influences **Specific Project Objectives** (Impacts can affect how well specific objectives are achieved).
- **Specific Project Objectives** are part of the **Whole Project** (Objectives are components of the overall project goals).

### Attributes:
- **Priority** could include levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Base Risk** might have categories (e.g., technical, financial, operational).
- **Probability** could be quantified (e.g., percentage likelihood).
- **Occurrence** might be described in terms of frequency (e.g., rare, occasional, frequent).
- **Potential Impact** could be assessed in terms of severity (e.g., minor, moderate, major).
- **Specific Project Objectives** may include metrics for success (e.g., timelines, deliverables).
- **Whole Project** could have attributes such as overall budget, timeline, and scope.

This structured analysis encapsulates the essential elements of project management risks based on the initial text.
