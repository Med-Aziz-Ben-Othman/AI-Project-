Based on the provided sentence "may residual risk remain response implement," here are the extracted nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Residual Risk**
   - Definition: The risk that remains after risk management strategies have been applied.
   
2. **Response**
   - Definition: Actions taken to mitigate or eliminate risks.

3. **Implementation**
   - Definition: The process of putting a decision or plan into effect.

### Relationships:
1. **"may remain"** 
   - Relationship between **Residual Risk** and **Response**: This indicates that despite responses being implemented, there is a possibility that residual risk can still exist.

2. **"response to"**
   - Relationship between **Response** and **Residual Risk**: This shows that the response is aimed at managing the residual risk.

3. **"to implement"**
   - Relationship between **Response** and **Implementation**: This suggests that responses need to be implemented as part of the risk management process.

### Attributes:
- **Residual Risk**
  - Attribute: Status (e.g., exists, mitigated)
  
- **Response**
  - Attribute: Type (e.g., avoidance, transfer, reduction)
  - Attribute: Effectiveness (e.g., high, medium, low)

- **Implementation**
  - Attribute: Timeline (e.g., immediate, short-term, long-term)
