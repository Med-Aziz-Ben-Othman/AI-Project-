Based on the provided sentence, here's a structured extraction of nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Emergent Nature Risk**
   - **Attributes**: Complexity, Unpredictability

2. **Project Risk Management Process**
   - **Attributes**: Iterative, Structured

3. **Risk**
   - **Attributes**: Identified, Evident

4. **Project**
   - **Attributes**: Contextual, Time-bound

### Relationships:
1. **Requires**
   - **From**: Emergent Nature Risk
   - **To**: Project Risk Management Process

2. **Is Part Of**
   - **From**: Project Risk Management Process
   - **To**: Identify Risk Process

3. **Iterates**
   - **From**: Identify Risk Process
   - **To**: Risk

4. **Finds**
   - **From**: Identify Risk Process
   - **To**: Risk

5. **Evident In**
   - **From**: Risk
   - **To**: Project

### Summary:
The emergent nature of risk necessitates the use of a project risk management process that is iterative. This process includes repeatedly identifying risks in order to find those that are evident in earlier stages of the project.
