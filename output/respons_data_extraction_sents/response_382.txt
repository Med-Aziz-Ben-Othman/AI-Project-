Based on the provided sentence, here are the extracted nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Response**
2. **Implementation**
3. **Potential Effect**
4. **Project Objective**
5. **Additional Risk**

### Relationships:
1. **Response** **leads to** **Implementation**: The action taken in response to a risk involves its implementation.
2. **Implementation** **affects** **Potential Effect**: The way the response is implemented can affect the potential outcomes or effects on the project.
3. **Potential Effect** **relates to** **Project Objective**: The potential effects of the response may impact the overall objectives of the project.
4. **Additional Risk** **generated by** **Response**: The response may generate new or additional risks that were not initially accounted for.
5. **Project Objective** **is influenced by** **Additional Risk**: The introduction of additional risks can influence the achievement of the project objectives.

### Attributes:
- **Response**: Action taken to manage or mitigate a risk.
- **Implementation**: The method or process by which the response is executed.
- **Potential Effect**: The anticipated outcomes resulting from the response.
- **Project Objective**: The goals or aims of the project that need to be achieved.
- **Additional Risk**: New risks that arise as a consequence of implementing the response.

This structured extraction highlights the interplay between risk responses and their implications for project management, offering a clear framework for understanding risks in project contexts.
