Based on the provided sentence "approve risk response associate action prior implementation," we can analyze and extract the following entities (nodes), relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes (Entities)
1. **Risk Response** 
   - Attribute: Type of response (e.g., mitigation, avoidance, transfer, acceptance)
  
2. **Action** 
   - Attribute: Specific steps or measures to be taken

3. **Implementation** 
   - Attribute: Process of executing the approved action

### Relationships
1. **Approve** 
   - Relationship: Action between a decision-maker (not explicitly mentioned) and the "Risk Response" indicating that the response requires validation or authorization.

2. **Associate** 
   - Relationship: Connects "Action" to "Risk Response," suggesting that the action is linked or tied to a specific risk response strategy.

3. **Prior** 
   - Relationship: Indicates a temporal relationship, suggesting that the "Action" must be addressed or taken before the "Implementation."

### Summary of Extraction
- **Nodes**:
  - Risk Response (Type of response)
  - Action (Specific steps)
  - Implementation (Process of execution)

- **Relationships**:
  - Approve (between decision-maker and Risk Response)
  - Associate (between Action and Risk Response)
  - Prior (temporal relation between Action and Implementation)

This structured extraction reflects the critical components and their interrelations within the context of project management risks.
