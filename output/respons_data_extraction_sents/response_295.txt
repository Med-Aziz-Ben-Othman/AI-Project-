Based on the provided sentence, we can extract the following nodes, relationships, and attributes related to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Risk** - The potential event or condition that may impact the project negatively.
2. **Priority** - The level of importance assigned to the identified risk.
3. **Objective** - The goal or intended outcome of the project that may be affected by the risk.
4. **Project** - The entire endeavor or initiative being managed.

### Relationships:
1. **Identifies** - The relationship between "identified risk" and "risk," indicating that the risk has been recognized.
2. **Assigns** - The relationship between "risk" and "priority," indicating that a priority level is given to the identified risk.
3. **Affects** - The relationship between "risk" and "objective," indicating that the risk may impact the project's objectives.
4. **Covers** - The relationship between "objective" and "project," suggesting that the objectives are part of the project as a whole.

### Attributes:
- **Risk**: Type (could be technical, financial, operational, etc.), Severity (high, medium, low).
- **Priority**: Level (high, medium, low), Urgency (immediate, short-term, long-term).
- **Objective**: Specificity (measurable, clear), Alignment (with project goals).
- **Project**: Scope (size, complexity), Duration (start and end dates).

This structured understanding helps in analyzing project management risks in a graph-based learning model context, where nodes can represent key concepts, and relationships define how these concepts interact within the domain of project management.
