### Nodes (Entities)
1. **Critical Success Factor**
2. **Risk**
3. **Process**
4. **Practice**
5. **Value**
6. **Effectiveness**
7. **Likelihood**
8. **Risk Practicable** (interpreted as types of risks that can be managed or mitigated)

### Relationships
1. **Identifies**: 
   - **Critical Success Factor** identifies **Risk**.
   - **Process** identifies **Risk**.
   
2. **Describes**: 
   - **Practice** describes the **Process**.

3. **Maximizes**: 
   - **Process** maximizes **Value**.

4. **Enhances**: 
   - **Process** enhances **Effectiveness**.
   - **Process** enhances **Likelihood** of identifying **Risk**.

5. **Involves**:
