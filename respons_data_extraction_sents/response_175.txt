Based on the provided sentence, the following nodes, relationships, and attributes can be extracted:

### Nodes:
1. **Risk**
   - Type: Project Management Concept
   - Attributes: Potential, Identified

2. **Response**
   - Type: Project Management Concept
   - Attributes: May (implying uncertainty or possibility)

3. **Time**
   - Type: Temporal Concept
   - Attributes: Associated with responses or risk management timelines

### Relationships:
1. **Identified** 
   - Relationship Type: Action/Process
   - Between: Risk → Response
   - Description: Indicates that a potential response has been recognized in relation to a risk.

2. **May** 
   - Relationship Type: Conditional/Probability
   - Between: Response → Risk
   - Description: Suggests that there is a possibility of implementing a response to mitigate the identified risk.

3. **Associated With**
   - Relationship Type: Contextual Link
   - Between: Response → Time
   - Description: Indicates that responses to risks may have time constraints or considerations.

### Summary:
The analysis reveals a focus on the identification of risks in project management, the potential responses to those risks, and the temporal considerations that may affect the implementation of these responses. Overall, the extracted entities and relationships provide a foundational understanding of how risks and responses are interlinked in the context of project management.
