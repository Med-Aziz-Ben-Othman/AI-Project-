Based on the provided sentence, I can identify the following nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Technique**
   - Type: Method/Approach
2. **Overall Risk Priority Measure**
   - Type: Metric/Assessment Tool
3. **Document**
   - Type: Artifact/Deliverable
4. **Plan**
   - Type: Strategy/Framework
5. **Risk Management Process**
   - Type: Procedure/Methodology

### Relationships:
1. **Technique** → **Creates** → **Overall Risk Priority Measure**
   - This indicates that the technique is used to generate or establish the overall risk priority measure.
   
2. **Overall Risk Priority Measure** → **Documented In** → **Document**
   - This shows that the overall risk priority measure is recorded or captured within a document.

3. **Document** → **Part Of** → **Plan**
   - This signifies that the document is an integral part of the risk management plan.

4. **Plan** → **Guides** → **Risk Management Process**
   - This indicates that the plan serves as a guiding framework for the risk management process.

### Attributes/Characteristics:
- **Technique**: Could include various methods such as qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, etc.
- **Overall Risk Priority Measure**: May define how risks are prioritized (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Document**: Could specify types of documents like risk registers, management plans, etc.
- **Plan**: May include components like objectives, strategies, and stakeholder involvement.
- **Risk Management Process**: Could define stages such as identification, assessment, response planning, and monitoring.

This structured extraction encapsulates the key components and their interrelationships in the context of project management risks, allowing for further analysis and representation in a graph-based learning model.
