Based on the provided sentence, I will extract the relevant nodes (entities), relationships, and attributes related to project management risks.

### Nodes (Entities)
1. **Result Analysis**
2. **Urgency Risk Response**
3. **Risk Response Plan**
4. **Probability**
5. **Plan Objective**
6. **Contingency Reserve**
7. **Confidence Level**

### Relationships
1. **Result Analysis** **may influence** **Urgency Risk Response**  
   (Result analysis can affect how urgently risks are responded to)
   
2. **Risk Response Plan** **depends on** **Probability**  
   (The plan for responding to risks is dependent on the likelihood of those risks occurring)
   
3. **Probability** **affects** **Plan Objective**  
   (The probability of risks can impact the achievement of the project's objectives)
   
4. **Plan Objective** **requires** **Contingency Reserve**  
   (Achieving the plan's objectives necessitates having a contingency reserve)
   
5. **Contingency Reserve** **provides** **Confidence Level**  
   (The presence of a contingency reserve contributes to the necessary level of confidence in project planning)

### Attributes
- **Urgency Risk Response**: Level of urgency (low, medium, high)
- **Probability**: Likelihood (quantitative measure, percentage)
- **Plan Objective**: Specific goals of the project
- **Contingency Reserve**: Amount set aside for unforeseen risks
- **Confidence Level**: Degree of certainty in achieving the plan objective (quantitative measure)

This structured extraction reflects the relationships and attributes inherent in project management risks as articulated in the provided text.
