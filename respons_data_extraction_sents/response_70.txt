Based on the provided sentence, the following nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks can be extracted:

### Nodes
1. **Quantitative Technique**
2. **Insight**
3. **Identified Risk**
4. **Project Outcome**

### Relationships
1. **Provides**: The relationship between "Quantitative Technique" and "Insight" implies that the technique yields or offers insight.
2. **Combines**: The relationship between "Insight" and "Identified Risk" suggests that the insight combines with identified risks to inform decisions.
