4. **Risk Management**
   - Attributes: Valid basis, Framework for identifying and mitigating risks

### Relationships
1. **Defines**: 
   - Relationship: "Clear definition" defines "Project Objectives"
2. **Influences**:
   - Relationship: "Project Environment" influences "Project Objectives"
3. **Requires**:
   - Relationship: "Solution Approach" requires "Project Objectives" for effective implementation
4. **Provides**:
   - Relationship: "Project Objectives" provide a "valid basis" for "Risk Management"
5. **Supports**:
   - Relationship: "Solution Approach" supports "Risk Management"

### Summary
- **Key Concept**: The clarity of project objectives is fundamental to the project's success and directly impacts risk management processes.
- **Attributes**: The attributes associated with each node help clarify their significance in the context of project management and risks.
