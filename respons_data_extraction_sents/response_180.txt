From the provided sentence, we can extract the following nodes, relationships, and attributes relevant to project management risks:

### Nodes:
1. **Early Risk Identification**
   - Attributes: Timing (early), Purpose (identification of risks)

2. **Key Project Decision**
   - Attributes: Importance (key), Context (project-related)

3. **Risk**
   - Attributes: Nature (inherent), Impact (may affect project)

4. **Project Strategy**
   - Attributes: Potential for Change (may result in change), Context (project-related)

### Relationships:
1. **enables**: 
   - Relationship between "Early Risk Identification" and "Key Project Decision" (Early risk identification enables key project decisions).

2. **takes into account**: 
   - Relationship between "Key Project Decision" and "Risk" (Key project decisions take maximum account of risks).

3. **may result in**: 
   - Relationship between "Risk" and "Project Strategy" (Risks may result in changes to project strategy).

### Summary:
- The sentence indicates that early identification of risks plays a crucial role in making important project decisions, as these decisions must consider inherent risks that could lead to changes in the project's strategy. 

This structured representation of nodes and relationships can help in building a graph-based model for further analysis of project management risks.
