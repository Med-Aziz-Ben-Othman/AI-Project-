Based on the provided sentence, I will extract the relevant entities (nodes), their relationships, and any attributes related to project management risks.

### Nodes:
1. **Contingent Risk** 
   - **Attributes**: Type of risk that may occur depending on certain conditions.

2. **Risk Response Action**
   - **Attributes**: A planned action to mitigate or manage a risk.

3. **Optimum Time**
   - **Attributes**: The most favorable or effective time for executing a risk response action.

### Relationships:
1. **Has**: 
   - **Contingent Risk** **has** a **Risk Response Action**.
   - This indicates that for a specific contingent risk, there is an associated risk response action that needs to be executed.

2. **Needs Execution**:
   - **Risk Response Action** **needs execution at** **Optimum Time**.
   - This implies that the risk response action must be carried out at the optimum time for maximum effectiveness.

### Summary:
- The analysis reveals that there is a contingent risk that necessitates an appropriate risk response action, which should be executed at the optimum time to effectively manage the risk. 

This structure can be used to inform graph-based models by representing nodes as entities and relationships as edges connecting these nodes, providing a clear understanding of how these concepts interact within project management risk contexts.
