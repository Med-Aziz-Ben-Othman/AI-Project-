Based on the provided sentence, the following nodes, relationships, and attributes can be extracted:

### Nodes:
1. **Risk**
   - Attributes: None specified, but can be inferred as a potential issue in project management.
  
2. **Time**
   - Attributes: "occur" (referring to the timing of risk occurrence)
  
3. **Resource**
   - Attributes: "scarce" (indicating limited availability)
  
4. **Recovery**
   - Attributes: None specified, but generally refers to the process of overcoming risks.
  
5. **Problem**
   - Attributes: None specified, but refers to the issues arising from risks.
  
6. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Attributes: None specified, but refers to strategies to minimize risks.

### Relationships:
1. **Risk - occurs at - Time**
   - Describes when risks are likely to occur.
  
2. **Resource - used for - Recovery**
   - Indicates that resources are utilized in the recovery process.
  
3. **Recovery - provides - realistic picture**
   - Suggests that effective recovery can give a true representation of the situation.
  
4. **Problem - arises from - Risk**
   - Indicates that problems are a consequence of risks.
  
5. **Risk Mitigation - utilizes - Resource**
   - Suggests that risk mitigation efforts require the use of resources, particularly those that are scarce.

### Structured Summary:
- **Nodes**: Risk, Time, Resource (scarce), Recovery, Problem, Risk Mitigation.
- **Relationships**:
  - Risk occurs at Time.
  - Resource is used for Recovery.
  - Recovery provides a realistic picture of the Problem.
  - Problem arises from Risk.
  - Risk Mitigation utilizes Resource.

This extraction highlights the interconnectedness of risks, resources, and recovery within the context of project management, emphasizing the importance of managing scarce resources during risk mitigation efforts.
