Based on the provided sentence, we can extract the following elements related to project management risks:

### Nodes (Entities):
1. **Risk**
2. **Description**
3. **State**
4. **Uncertainty**
5. **Cause**
6. **Effect**

### Relationships:
1. **Risk** has a **Description** (relationship: "has")
2. **Risk** has a **State** (relationship: "has")
3. **State** has an **Uncertainty** (relationship: "is associated with")
4. **Cause** leads to an **Effect** (relationship: "results in")

### Attributes:
- **Risk**: may have attributes such as "level of severity," "likelihood of occurrence," etc. (not explicitly stated in the sentence).
- **Uncertainty**: could be characterized by "degree" or "type" (not explicitly stated in the sentence).

### Summary of Extraction:
- **Nodes**: Risk, Description, State, Uncertainty, Cause, Effect
- **Relationships**: 
  - Risk has Description
  - Risk has State
  - State is associated with Uncertainty
  - Cause results in Effect
- **Attributes**: Potential attributes for nodes, such as severity for Risk or degree for Uncertainty, though not mentioned in the sentence. 

This structured understanding can be utilized for graph-based learning models to analyze project management risks and their interconnections.
