Based on the provided text, here is the analysis:

### Nodes (Entities)
1. **Response**
   - Type: Action/Strategy
   - Attributes: Can be proactive or reactive.

2. **Implement**
   - Type: Action
   - Attributes: Involves execution and resource allocation.

3. **Consider**
   - Type: Action
   - Attributes: Involves evaluation and analysis.

4. **Plan**
   - Type: Document/Strategy
   - Attributes: Structured approach for managing risks.

5. **Risk**
   - Type: Concept
   - Attributes: Uncertainty that can affect project outcomes.

6. **Process**
   - Type: Framework/Methodology
   - Attributes: Series of steps for risk management.

### Relationships
1. **Response** 
   - **is part of** → **Risk Response Process**
   - (A response is an integral component of the overall risk response process.)

2. **Implement**
   - **is a step in** → **Risk Response Process**
   - (Implementation is a critical action within the risk response process.)

3. **Consider**
   - **is a preliminary step to** → **Plan**
   - (Considering various factors is necessary before creating a plan.)

4. **Plan**
   - **addresses** → **Risk**
   - (Planning involves identifying and addressing risks.)

5. **Process**
   - **includes** → **Plan**
   - (The risk response process includes the planning phase.)

6. **Response**
   - **is influenced by** → **Risk**
   - (The nature of the risk determines the type of response implemented.)

### Summary
The extracted nodes represent key concepts and actions within the realm of project management risks. The relationships illustrate how these entities interact and contribute to managing risks effectively. The attributes provide additional context about the nature and role of each entity in the risk management framework.
